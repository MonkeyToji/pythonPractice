Python comes with a "standard library" like print,len, etc
Modules have groups of similar functions like a Math module or the random module

import <module name> is how to call in those Modules

DONT NAME PROGRAMS SAME AS MODULES

FROM <MODULE NAME> IMPORT *
dont need module name to run, but looks less clear

import sys
sys.exit terminates PROGRAMS
